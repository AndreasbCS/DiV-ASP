# DiV-ASP
Dialogue Verification in Answer Set Programming (ASP)

## Development in Progress

> This repository hosts methods for **formal verification of human interactions**, focusing on representing (typically non-collaborative) agent-behaviors, including **social engineering, phishing, deception, and manipulation**.
> 
> The approaches developed here aim to incorporate models that go beyond reasoning about observable actions to make inferences about the dynamics of human mental states, such as beliefs and intentions.
> 
> This research contributes to security, forensic analysis, and automated dialogue verification. Further developments and implementations will be made available in this repository.
